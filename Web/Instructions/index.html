        <br>
        <span class="h3">Speed is a 2 Player game, where each Player competes to empty their decks, each consisting of 26 cards. <br><br> At the start of the Game, 4 Cards are taken from the Players' decks, and displayed to both Players. Additionally, at the start of each New Round, a card is taken from both players and placed in the centre as 2 different piles. <br><br> To place a card, you need to select a card among the 4 they have (at the bottom of the screen), and then clicking one of the cards in the centre; the card can only be placed if the centre card chosen is consecutive in number (1 more or 1 less); in this game, Ace and King are considered consecutive. <br><br> The aim is to be as <em>quick</em> to play, as your opponent is also given the chance to place cards in the time you waste. Once a card is placed, you may click the Deck on the right of your cards, to refill the empty slots. <br><br> Once there are no moves you are able to play you may click on the button labelled 'End Round', and wait till your opponent does the same; a New Round will then start, beginning with the setting out of a card from each Player's deck. If your deck has been emptied, you would need to choose a card before clicking the button. </span>
